The `scope` works for everything else other than `order` and `limit` in has many through relation.
Due to this issue https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/4376 (separate is used for these two options to work in relations)

I donâ€™t see any direct alternative that can be done in this extension but sorting can be achieved if we directly call the findAll on sequelize something like this
```ts
this.doctorRepo.sequelizeModel.findAll({
      include: 'patients',
      order: [[Sequelize.literal('Patients.id'), 'DESC']],
});
```

Though it also include the through table result

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Dr. Two",
    "patients": [
      {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "A Patient 4",
        "Appointment": {
          "id": 4,
          "doctorId": 2,
          "patientId": 4
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Dr. Joe",
    "patients": [
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "A Patient 3",
        "Appointment": {
          "id": 3,
          "doctorId": 1,
          "patientId": 3
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Patient 2",
        "Appointment": {
          "id": 2,
          "doctorId": 1,
          "patientId": 2
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Patient 1",
        "Appointment": {
          "id": 1,
          "doctorId": 1,
          "patientId": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
